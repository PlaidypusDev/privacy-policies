# Privacy Policies

This repository hosts privacy policies for the applications we build. These policies are hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

# Add a new policy

1. Create a new markdown file in the root directory
2. Create a policy using a tool like the [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/)
3. Add a reference to the policy in [`index.md`](index.md)
4. The policy will be visible at https://plaidypusdev.github.io/privacy-policies/your-new-markdown-file-name
